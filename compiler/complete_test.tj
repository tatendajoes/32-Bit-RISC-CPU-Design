# Complete test program in TJ language
# This program demonstrates all supported operations

# Arithmetic operations
r1 = r2 + r3    # ADD: r1 = r2 + r3
r4 = r1 - r2    # SUB: r4 = r1 - r2  
r5 = r1 & r2    # AND: r5 = r1 & r2
r6 = r1 | r2    # OR:  r6 = r1 | r2
r7 = r1 < r2    # SLT: r7 = 1 if r1 < r2, else 0

# Memory operations
memory[0] = r1   # STORE: Save r1 to memory address 0
memory[4] = r4   # STORE: Save r4 to memory address 4
r8 = memory[0]   # LOAD:  Load from memory address 0 to r8
r9 = memory[4]   # LOAD:  Load from memory address 4 to r9

# Branch operation (simple test)
if r1 == r2:     # BEQ: Branch if r1 equals r2
